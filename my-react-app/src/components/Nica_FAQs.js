      <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
      <h3>THE LOCATION</h3>
      <p>
        Fly into Liberia, Costa Rica, at Guanacaste International Airport (LIR) or Managua, Nicaragua, to Augusto C. Sandino International Airport (MGA). From there, we head to the beautiful Playa Maderas, where we will be for the duration of our time here!

        San Juan del Sur is located on the island's southwest side, but just twenty minutes north, Playa Maderas boasts some of the world's most famous surfing. Playa Maderas is located on the island's Pacific side, surrounded by lush jungles to protect you from the mainland, cliff formations to the north, and other stunning beaches.

      <p>
        Once a tiny beach town fishing village, Playa Maderas has evolved into a peaceful and tranquil surfer's paradise.

      <h3>FLIGHTS</h3>
      <p>
        We will have two shuttles one from Managua Airport (MGA) at 3pm and the other one from Liberia Airport (LIR) at 3pm. We recommend flying into either one, both are about equal distance from our villas, so go for the cheaper option.

        We have never had any trouble, never seen strangers wandering around, and always left computers and phones out without worry - and we've been going here since 2015 - very sexy and safe!

      <h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
      <p>
        This is the fun part, we typically get 4x4 gators which helps us get to the surf faster, but honestly, the beach is a 3-minute walk from our villas. Of course, we'll set up transport to and from the airport if you fly in on recommended flights, but we can even help arrange your private transfers with our trusted partners if needed.
